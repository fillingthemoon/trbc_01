Thinking of visiting TRBC? Here are some commonly asked questions our visitors have.

&nbsp;

# What are your services like?
Our Sunday worship services (8:30am, 10:30am, 5:00pm) are a time of praising God through songs and being taught from the Bible through our pastors.

Before or after the worship services, we also have Sunday school classes where we gather in small classes either online or in-person, to learn from the Bible. 

We hope that your heart will be drawn closer to Him through each service and gathering in TRBC.

&nbsp;

# Is your church family friendly?
We have children, youth and senior fellowship groups in TRBC. Whether you have young children or senior family members, we hope your first visit to TRBC will be friendly and enjoyable for your whole family.
